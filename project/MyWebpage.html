            <br>
                <h3>How Does Transportation Impact Climate?</h3>
                    <p>In many ways, climate change and modern transportation go hand in hand. The life-changing technological advances from the Industrial Revolution that ushered in new modes of travel are the same technologies that have contributed to the wide-scale pollution of the planet. As machinery began to replace manual labor in the latter half of the eighteenth century, the use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, for power increased. Exciting new transportation vehicles, like cars and steam-powered trains and boats, were also powered by fossil fuels, which release large quantities of carbon dioxide into the air when burned. These growing levels of carbon dioxide have generated a significant greenhouse effect, which has caused the planet to warm at a much more rapid pace—and to higher temperatures—than pre-Industrial Revolution rates, thus leading to the changes in climate seen in the twenty-first century.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 2017, the U.S. transportation sector generated the largest percentage of greenhouse gases emitted in the United States at 29 percent. Globally, transportation accounts for between 15 and 20 percent of emissions each year. Motor vehicles are the leading cause of air pollution in the United States, though other modes of travel, such as planes and cruise ships, create greater emissions per voyage per person.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>What Large-Scale Changes Can Be Implemented to Make Transportation Greener?</h3>
                    <p>Those concerned about climate change are taking steps to mitigate the effects of transportation on Earth’s atmosphere. Car manufacturers are developing and promoting electric vehicles, and scientists are exploring alternative fuels like hydrogen fuel cells. Created from renewable energy sources, these fuel cells would help end dependence on fossil fuels. High-speed railways with trains powered by electricity are another eco-friendly option that would emit less carbon dioxide than traditional diesel trains and would offer reasonable travel alternatives for airline consumers. Some countries, such as England, are considering instituting a “frequent flyer levy,” which would progressively increase an individual’s taxes on flights taken in the same year. This would hopefully reduce the overall number of flights taken each year, while not unfairly penalizing those who only fly once or twice annually.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>What Can Individuals Do? </h3>
                    <p>For individuals, the first step in reducing emissions is researching the travel options available and investigating one’s relative carbon footprint. There are several online calculators that can estimate the emissions of a trip based on the mode of transportation. For short distances, walking or riding a bike is the obvious choice for low-to-no carbon emissions. Public transportation like buses, subways, and trolleys are almost always better than driving a car, because the more people traveling in a vehicle, the smaller the carbon footprint of each person. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When traveling over longer distances, taking to the rails is typically the best course of action. In nearly all circumstances, trains have considerably lower emissions than planes, especially if the train is electric. (Diesel trains can have emissions twice as high as electric trains.) Taking a full train versus an empty one also lowers one’s carbon footprint, so traveling during peak times is the better option. For similar reasons, taking a long-distance bus ride is another lower-emission option, because of the number of people who make the trip together. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While cars have greater emissions than trains and buses, they are still usually a better choice than flying, especially when carpooling, or driving with multiple people in the car. Replacing short flights with a car or train trip is more Earth-friendly, because taking off in a plane uses more fuel than cruising and it accounts for a larger portion of the trip for a short flight. In addition to buying an electric or hybrid car, routine car maintenance to keep the car as fuel-efficient as possible—for instance, keeping tires properly inflated—can go a long way in lowering emissions over time. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If flying is the only option, there are some general rules for decreasing one’s carbon footprint, though emissions vary widely between airlines. Taking large commercial airliners, which seat more people and therefore have lower carbon emissions per person, instead of smaller planes like private jets, is an oft-mentioned idea for combating greenhouse gas emissions. As with other methods of transportation, traveling on a full plane also helps to lower overall emissions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Boats vary widely with regards to their carbon emissions. Smaller boats can be modified to be low or no-emission, while cruise ships rival planes with their sizeable carbon footprint. Still, you could always use a zero-emission sailboat to travel and see the world, Greta Thunberg-style!</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Tropical Deforestation and Global Warming</h3>
                    <p>Tropical forest trees, like all green plants, take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during photosynthesis. Plants also carry out the opposite process—known as respiration—in which they emit carbon dioxide, but generally in smaller amounts than they take in during photosynthesis. The surplus carbon is stored in the plant, helping it to grow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When trees are cut down and burned or allowed to rot, their stored carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide. And this is how deforestation and forest degradation contribute to global warming. According to the best current estimate, deforestation is responsible for about 10 percent of all global warming emissions. (Where did that 10 percent figure come from?)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why does deforestation occur? Forests are cleared to make way for any of a long list of agricultural products and other human activities. But UCS analysis shows that a majority of tropical deforestation occurring today can be traced to just four globally traded commodities: beef, soybeans, palm oil, and wood products.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Benefits of Reducing Deforestation</h3>
                    <p>We need to protect tropical forests from deforestation and degradation if we want to reduce emissions to the levels needed to protect the planet against the worst global warming impacts. Ending deforestation will not solve global warming by itself, of course—urgent action is needed to cut the other 90 percent of emissions. But the problem cannot be solved if the role of tropical deforestation is ignored.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And reducing deforestation has other benefits beyond reducing global warming pollution. Tropical forests are home to many unique species of animals and plants. Animals such as the jaguar risk extinction if we do not act to protect their tropical forest habitat. In addition, tropical forests are crucial sources of food, medicine, and clean drinking water for people in developing countries. Tropical forests help regulate regional rainfall and prevent both floods and droughts. Reducing deforestation is not only a beneficial action against global warming—it also can make important contributions to saving biodiversity and supporting sustainable development.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Deforestation Solutions</h3>
                    <p>The good news is that tropical deforestation can be reduced—and, in many places, already is being reduced. A variety of approaches, from corporate deforestation-free commitments to the REDD+ initiative to the Soy Moratorium, have shown promising results. Continuing progress will require a sustained commitment by governments, businesses, consumers, and non-governmental organizations to the goal of ending—and, where possible, reversing—tropical deforestation.</p>

                <h3>What are fossil fuels?</h3>
                    <p>Fossil fuels are formed from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organisms that died millions of years ago. They create carbon-rich deposits that are extracted and burned for energy. They are non-renewable and currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy. They are also used to make plastic, steel and a huge range of products. There are three types of fossil fuel – coal, oil and gas.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>What is the impact of fossil fuels on our planet?</h3>
                    <p>When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C. Warming above 1.5°C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>How big is the impact of fossil fuels on climate change and our planet?</h3>
                    <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels and responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures – making it the single largest source of global temperature rise. Oil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned - approximately a third of the world’s total carbon emissions. There have also been a number of oil spills in recent years that have a devastating impact on our ocean’s ecosystem. Natural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, it is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the world’s total carbon emissions.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Can we continue to burn fossil fuels?</h3>
                    <p>The IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In 2015, the world’s governments signed up to the Paris Agreement committing to reduce carbon emissions. However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>What’s the role of fossil fuel companies in the future of our planet?</h3>
                    <p>Fossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP’s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP – it’s an industry-wide problem.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That’s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP’s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels. In February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company’s new policy promising an end to ‘corporate reputation advertising’. He also committed BP to redirecting its advertising resources towards advocating for progressive climate policies.</p>

                <h3>Resources and Production</h3>
                    <p>Animal agriculture puts a heavy strain on many of the Earth’s finite land, water and energy resources. In order to accommodate the 70 billion animals raised annually for human consumption, a third of the planet’s ice-free land surface, as well as nearly sixteen percent of global freshwater, is devoted to growing livestock. Furthermore, a third of worldwide grain production is used to feed livestock. By 2050, consumption of meat and dairy products is expected to rise 76 and 64 percent respectively, which will increase the resource burden from the industry. Cattle are by far the biggest source of emissions from animal agriculture, with one recent study showing that in an average American diet, beef consumption creates 1,984 pounds of CO2e annually. Replacing beef with plants would reduce that figure 96 percent, bringing it down to just 73 pounds of CO2e.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Consequences and Impacts</h3>
                    <p>Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock, a widely-cited 2013 report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), estimates about 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions, or 7.1 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, can be attributed to the livestock sector annually. This is broadly equivalent to the emissions from all the fuel burned by all the world’s transport vehicles, including cars, trucks, trains, boats and airplanes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Animal agriculture specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accounts for five percent of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions;</li>
                        <li>Represents 44 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions, the primary driver of  climate change related to livestock, as methane is 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 100 years;</li>
                        <li>Comprises 44 percent of all anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions, the most potent GHG; and</li>
                        <li>Makes up 75-80 percent of total agricultural emissions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Furthermore, air and water pollution can be directly attributed to the livestock sector, which is the largest contributor to global water pollution. The livestock sector is also one of the leading drivers of global deforestation, and is linked to 75 percent of historic deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. Nearly a third of biodiversity loss to date has been linked to animal agriculture. Further amplifying water and air pollution, global livestock produce seven to nine times more sewage than humans, most of which is left untreated. They also discharge pesticides, antibiotics, and heavy metals into water systems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Animal agriculture is linked to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>55 percent of erosion;</li>
                        <li>60 percent of nitrogen pollution; and</li>
                        <li>70 percent of the global dietary phosphorus footprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Concentrated animal farming operations present additional public health risks to nearby communities, as viral diseases may spread from sick livestock to humans and the increased use of antibiotics encourages antibiotic resistance. Irresponsible manure management from high-volume facilities risks aerosolizing fecal matter that may reach nearby homes and cause respiratory problems. Livestock waste can also pass through the soil to groundwater, which may then contaminate nearby streams and rivers with nitrates and pathogens.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Mitigation and Action</h3>
                    <p>Global GHG emissions from the livestock sector increased by 51 percent between 1961 and 2010, spurred by a 54 percent increase in methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock manure. Moreover, approximately one gigaton of carbon dioxide equivalent worth of animal-based foods is wasted globally every year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If global consumption of meat and dairy continues to grow at the current pace, the agriculture sector could consume about 70 percent of the allowable budget for all GHG emissions by mid-century. To meet the global goal of limiting warming to 2°C, annual emissions must be reduced from today’s levels of 49 gigatons of CO2 to around 23 gigatons by 2050. Agriculture would use up 20 of those gigatons, leaving only three for the rest of the global economy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>GHG intensity from the average western diet could be cut in half by adopting a plant-based diet. Agricultural emissions can also be limited through smarter livestock handling, technology-enabled monitoring of fertilizer application, simple changes in field layout and other, more efficient agricultural techniques. Groups like Solutions from the Land are working with American farmers to find ways to reduce emissions without sacrificing production, and the US Department of Agriculture set up Climate Hubs to help farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change. Meanwhile, international groups like the Consortium of International Agricultural Researchers and the International Food Policy Research Institute are conducting ground-breaking research to determine just how climate change will impact farmers and what they can do about it.</p>
